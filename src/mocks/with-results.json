They say that especially those who have left their homeland constantly hear these sounds. The first part of this film takes place in the arid land east of Turkey. Memories of a childhood romance, children’s games and laughter, sleeping with an ill mother, are sandwiched with close-up images of eyes wide-open, blood, fear, and tension. The second narrative half tells the story of a man and his infant son who for no apparent reason jump to their death off a bridge on the Bosphorus, and a wife who follows. Dramatizing a true story, the film expresses the desperation and frustration of those who had no choice but to migrate to Istanbul from their beloved homeland.",
